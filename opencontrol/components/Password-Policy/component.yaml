          The Drupal project "Password Policy" allows administrators to define and enforce user password policies.

          Limitations - "Password policies only apply to passwords set via user forms in the web interface. Passwords changed by other means (Drush, web services, etc.) may not be subject to password policy constraints. Please see the following issue if you would like to contribute to removing this limitation: #2451159: Password policy doesn't work when updating the user" ([Project Password Policy](https://www.drupal.org/project/password_policy))
